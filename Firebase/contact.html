          <h2 style ="color: white; text-align: center; margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px"> The goal for this website was to create a
          place where people could get genuine, unbiased reviews for the games that they are insterested in. Users can read reviews for any game they can think of, as well as write their own review. The end goal is to reduce the number of fake, biased reviews that are frequently shown all over the internet for reviews that you know have been genuinely written.</h2>

          <h2 style ="color: white; text-align: center; margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px"> Hi, my name is Stefan Ateljevic and I am a grade 10 student at Upper Canada College. I am very passionate about video games, and I always want information on the latest games. My problem is, I always get very different opinions from game sites that are biased, and whose reviews are not genuine. This is why I decided to create my own review website, where the community can come together and give their thoughts on games, as well as receive thoughts. I hope you enjoy your time on Stefan's Game Site!</h2>
