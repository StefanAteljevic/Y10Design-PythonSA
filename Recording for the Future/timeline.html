      <h2>The Beginning: 1952 - 1962</h2>
      <p>Video games began their journey as the creations of scientists who were working in research labs. One example is <i>Tic-tac-toe</i>, created by British professor A.S Douglas as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Cambridge (1952). Another example is <i>Tennis for Two</i>, created by William Higinbotham on a large analog computer (1958).</p>

      <h2>The First Home Console: 1967</h2>
      <p>Developers at Sanders Associates, Inc. invented a multiplayer video game system that was capable of being played on a television. It was originally called <b>The Brown Box</b>, but was rebranded as <b>The Odyssey</b> (1972). Unfortunately, the console eventually fizzled and died out.</p>

      <h2>Pong: 1975</h2>
      <p>A company known as <b>Atari</b> was inspired by one of the 28 games from <b>The Odyssey</b>. This inspiration led to the release of the first arcade video game known as <i>Pong</i>. <b>Atari</b> also released a home version which was just as successful as the arcade version. <i>Pong’s</i> commercial success helped to establish the video game industry.</p>

      <p><b>Atari</b> was able to build on their success by creating their own home console, known as the <b>Atari 2600</b>. Its most notable features included joysticks, interchangeable game cartridges, and multi-colored games. The console was a triumph, and kicked off the second generation of consoles.

      <h2>The Video Game Crash: 1983</h2>
      <p>The North American video game industry experienced a major “crash” due to a number of factors, including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous <i>E.T.</i>, an <b>Atari</b> game based on the eponymous movie and often considered the worst game ever created. The crash led to the bankruptcy of several companies.

      <p><b>Nintendo</b>, which began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released a number of important video game franchises still around today, such as <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, and <i>Metroid</i>.

      <p><b>Nintendo</b> made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit <i>Game Boy</i> video game device and the often-bundled game <i>Tetris</i>. Over the next 25 years, <b>Nintendo</b> would release a number of successful successors to the <i>Game Boy</i>, including the <i>Game Boy color</i> in 1998, <i>Nintendo DS</i> in 2004, and <i>Nintendo 3DS</i> in 2011.

      <h2>The First Console War (Sega Genesis, SNES): 1990s</h2>
      <p>The <i>Sega Genesis</i> had technological superiority to the <i>NES</i>, clever marketing, and the 1991 release of the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> game. To counter, <b>Nintendo</b> released its 16-bit <i>Super NES</i> console in North America, launching the first real “console war.” With a much larger library of games, lower price point, and successful marketing, the <i>Genesis</i> had leapfrogged ahead of the <i>SNES</i> in North America by the mid-1990s.

      <h2>3D Gaming (Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Nintendo 64): 1990s</h2>
      <p>In 1995, <b>Sega</b> released its <i>Saturn</i> system, the first 32-bit console that played games on CDs rather than cartridges, five months ahead of schedule. This move was to beat <b>Sony’s</b> first foray into video games, the <i>Playstation</i>, which sold for $100 less than the <i>Saturn</i> when it launched later that year. The following year, <b>Nintendo</b> released its cartridge-based 64-bit system, the <i>Nintendo 64</i>.

      <h2>Sony’s Domination: Late 1990s - Early 2000s</h2>
      <p><b>Sony</b> dominated the video game market and would continue to do so into the next generation. In fact, the <i>Playstation 2</i>, released in 2000 and able to play original <i>Playstation</i> games, would become the best-selling game console of all time. The <i>Playstation 2</i>, which was the first console that used DVDs, went up against the <b>Sega</b> <i>Dreamcast</i> (released in 1999), the <b>Nintendo</b><i> Gamecube</i> (2001), and <b>Microsoft’s</b><i> Xbox</i> (2001).

Though the <i>Playstation 3</i>—the only system at the time to play Blu-rays—was successful in its own right, <b>Sony</b>, for the first time, faced stiff competition from its rivals.

      <p>Towards the end of the decade and beginning of the next, video games spread to social media platforms like <b>Facebook</b> and mobile devices like the <b>iPhone</b>, reaching a more casual gaming audience. <b>Rovio</b>, the company behind the <i>Angry Birds</i> mobile device game (and, later <i>Angry Birds</i> animated movie), reportedly made a whopping $200 million in 2012.

      <h2>Accessories: 2011</h2>
      <p><i>Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure</i> brought video games into the physical world. The game requires players to place plastic toy figures (sold separately) onto an accessory, which reads the toys’ NFC tags to bring the characters into the game. The next few years would see several sequels and other toy-video game hybrids, such as <i>Disney Infinity</i>, which features <b>Disney</b> characters.

      <h2>Current Generation: 2013 - Present</h2>
      <p>The 8th and current generation of video games began with the release of <b>Nintendo’s</b> <i>Wii U</i> in 2012, followed by the <i>Playstation 4</i> and <i>Xbox One</i> in 2013. Despite featuring a touch screen remote control that allowed off-TV gaming and being able to play <i>Wii</i> games, the <i>Wii U</i> was a commercial failure—the opposite of its competition—and was discontinued in 2017.
      <br></br>
      In 2016, <b>Sony</b> released a more powerful version of its console, called the <i>Playstation 4</i> Pro, the first console capable of 4K video output. In early 2017, <b>Nintendo</b> released its <i>Wii U</i> successor, the <b>Nintendo</b><i> Switch</i>, the only system to allow both television-based and handheld gaming. <b>Microsoft</b> released its 4K-ready console, the <i>Xbox One X</i>, in late 2017.
      <br></br>
      With their new revamped consoles, both <b>Sony</b> and <b>Microsoft</b> currently have their sights set on virtual reality gaming, a technology that has the potential to change the way players experience video games.
